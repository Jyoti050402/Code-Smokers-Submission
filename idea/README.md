#### by Team Code-Smokers

India is the land of paradoxes. We worship Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth. On the other hand, the education and the financial independence of women always remains the last thing to be considered. Looking at the prevailing conditions of the rural women in India, we present:

### "THE UNVEIL WAY"
* Making education accessible to rural women.
* Enabling their economic freedom.

#### How will it be ensured?
* Enabling women to sell their products online.
* Upload educational content in the form of videos.
* Making podcasts

We provide some practical solutions for empowering the rural women of India which will make their live better. The unveil platform tries to fill all the gaps and loopholes in the rural lives. Look into the Idea file and dive deep into our proposed idea.
